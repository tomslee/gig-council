# Privacy Policy

We encourage you not to enter any private data into this app. As an early-stage
app, security may not be the greatest.

The sessions and assignments that you enter are stored, together with the user name you
enter on login, in a Firebase database. Access to that may not be strongly protected.

On login, please choose a user name that you can remember, but not one that identifies
you individually.
